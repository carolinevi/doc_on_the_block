    <p class="firsttext">Finding the right doctor can be very difficult, whether it includes finding the type of specialized doctor or the location of the doctor that you need. That's why at DocOnTheBlock, we are able to connect patients with doctors by analyzing different attributes about your illness or sickness by accessing the questionnaire that is filled our by you and using the information to figure out what needs to be treated. A big issue that many people come across is finding a good doctor in the area that specializes in what they need, and this program will hopefully make this connection easier and more accessible to everyone who uses it. In addition to this, doctors commonly face the challenge of comprehending exactly what a patients issue is, therefore, the survey will allow the patient to have a better understanding of exactly what hurts and what actions need to be done in order to lead to the quickest recovery possible.</p>
