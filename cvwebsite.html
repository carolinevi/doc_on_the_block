      <div class ="SantoriniGreece">
        <h1 id="santorini"> 3. Santorini, Greece </h1>
        <<img src="santorini.jpg" height="270" width= "400">
        <p>The island of Santorini is probably the most intriguing island of Greece. Simply its name is more than enough to unfold in mind stunning sunsets and scenery, white, red and black sand beaches, impresive traditional houses, balconies with vew to the Volcano and and lively night life. All the above, allong with the remains of the antiquity and the myth of the Lost Atlantis justify the words which the tourists determine this wonderful island. The active volcano of Santorini erupted in the 50's and ruined many towns of the island. Santorini is also called Thira and its capital is the town of Fira. It is a very touristy island and therefore rather expensive.The locals live mainly off agriculture and tourism. The islands largest export product is soil; 2.000.000 tons a year are used all over the world, mainly to make concrete. The central part of the volcano sank into the sea leading to the emergence of Santorini itself and the tiny neighbouring islands of Thirasia, Palaia and Nea Kameni close by. Today, Santorini is the only inhabited Caldera (volcano cauldron) in the world. Unlike other islands in Greece, the towns and villages sit densely on top of the massive cliffs of the Caldera and from a distance appear like snow capping the towering mountain tops. The coloured strata of the volcanic rock of these cliffs are spectacular in themselves: chocolate brown, rust red, yellow ochre, white and cream. The geological uniqueness however is not the only thing that makes Santorini a special holiday destination.
        <div class= "IbizaSpain">
          <h1 id="ibiza"> 4. Ibiza, Spain </h1>
          <<img src="ibiza.jpg" height="270" width= "400">
          <p> Ibiza’s popularity as a summer party spot means that it is imperative to book hotels and flights well in advance during the peak months of July and August when prices are up and availability is down. Many airlines run charters during high season, so savings are available to visitors willing to fly at unsociable hours on budget carriers. There are lots of options for accommodation, from budget hostels to 5-star luxury resorts and spas. Most are mid-range and focused either on families or young party people. Some visitors opt for a live-aboard sailing package for something a bit different. The food of the Balearic Islands is particularly appealing to lovers of Spanish cuisine and seafood, although pub grub, fast food and international favorites such as Indian and Italian are also readily available.The beaches range from long popular stretches to secluded coves. However, Ibiza’s natural attractions are not limited to just sand. The cliffs, mountains and nature reserves are known for their interesting variety of plant and animal species, including huge flocks of migrating flamingos that frequent Ses Salinas National Park every year towards summer’s wane. These are balanced by manmade sights, including the World Heritage listed Dalt Villa, the charming walled old town.
          <div class="AmsterdamNetherlands">
             <h1 id="amsterdam"> 5. Amsterdam, Netherlands </h1>
              <img src="amsterdam.jpg" height="270" width="400">
              <p>Amsterdam is one of the greatest small cities in the world. From Amsterdam canals to world-famous Amsterdam museums and historical Amsterdam sights, it is one of the most romantic and beautiful cities in Europe. Canal cruises are a popular way to see the city from the perspective of its canals. Amsterdam is also a city of tolerance and diversity. It has all the advantages of a big city: rich culture, lively Amsterdam nightlife, international restaurants, good transport - but is quiet, and largely thanks to its extensive canals, has a little road traffic. In this city your destination is never far away, but get a bike for an authentic local experience.
          <div class ="SplitCroatia">
            <h1 id="split"> 6. Split, Croatia </h1>
            <img src="split.jpg" heigh="270" width="400">
            <p> Croatia's second-largest city, Split (Spalato in Italian) is a great place to see Dalmatian life as it’s really lived. Always buzzing, this exuberant city has just the right balance between tradition and modernity. Step inside Diocletian’s Palace (a Unesco World Heritage Site and one of the world’s most impressive Roman monuments) and you’ll see dozens of bars, restaurants and shops thriving amid the atmospheric old walls where Split has been humming along for thousands of years.To top it off, Split has a unique setting. Its dramatic coastal mountains act as the perfect backdrop to the turquoise waters of the Adriatic and help divert attention from the dozens of shabby high-rise apartment blocks that fill its suburbs. It's this thoroughly lived-in aspect of Split that means it will never be a fantasy land like Dubrovnik, but perhaps it's all the better for that.

            <h1 id="ortona">  9. Ortona, Italy </h1>
            <img src="ortona.jpg" height="270" width="400">
            <p> Ortona is a port and its important deep-water access was protected by the huge 15th century Argonese castle that was built after a particularly heavy attack by the Venetians in 1447.

          <div class= "BarcelonaSpain">
            <h1 id="barcelona"> 10. Barcelona, Spain </h1>
            <img src="barcelon.jpg" height="270" width="400">
            <P> Barcelona, located at the Mediterranean sea in the very north of the Spanish coast, is certainly the most cosmopolitan and economically most active city in this country. It has always proved its will to be modern, to follow the latest international tendencies or be ahead of them. To the tourist this is evident specially in its architecture, which so well reflects the general approach to life in this always pulsating city. Of course, Barcelona has an old history, and there are monuments of Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance periods or still before, but most characteristic is what has been built during the last, say, 100 years.Barcelona has been a center of Modernist architecture and is distinguished specially by the works of genial Antoní Gaudí, who together with his great contemporaries gave new and exciting looks to it, but has remained since then at the top of modernity.
